            The Bandcamp Daily is the editorial publication arm of Bandcamp that spotlights the best, most interesting, and strangest music on the platform from across the globe. It’s a treasure trove of wonderful writing and careful curation. The humans that run it are brave and gifted explorers of the Bandcamp-verse. Yes, that’s right — music curation by real humans :)

            I was the lead engineer on the team for the redesign effort. I built the site using a third-party headless CMS to power a frontend built within the Bandcamp ecosystem. The redesign accomplished the following things:
            <ul>
                <li>Ability to wishlist</li>
                <li>Ability to follow artist</li>
                <li>Improved player experience, displaying artist’s merch</li>
                <li>Improved reading experience: listen while reading</li>
                <li>Customized look and feel, made it feel like Bandcamp, moved from dated blog template to professional publication</li>
                <li>Expose many more opportunities for exploring more articles: view-all menu, franchises, pagination, contributors, genres</li>
            </ul>
