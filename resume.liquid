      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Senior Engineering Lead at Bandcamp, where I build tools that help artists and fans connect through music. I care deeply about the products I work on: how they look, how they feel, how they’re structured under the hood, and how long they’ll last. I believe in knowing a product’s quirks, crafting resilient systems, collaborating closely with teammates to make thoughtful decisions, and shipping early and often.

        <span>May 2017 — Present</span>
          <h4>Bandcamp Homepage Redesign (2025)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Increased conversion by X</li>
            <li>Improved time-to-interactive by X</li>
            <li>Improved accessibility score by X</li>
            <li>Frontend & backend migration from legacy monolith to microservices + Vue/TS</li>
            <li>Worked closely with design and product with creative problem solving and scoping to identify optimal new UX in tight timeline</li>
            <li>Introduced major new components and capabilities into our young design system</li>
            <li>Coordinated internal accessibility remediation and testing</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Track-and-Album Page Redesign (2023, mobile web)</h4>
          <p>
            The Track-and-Album Page is Bandcamp’s most critical product page and the heart of the business. It’s the only place where albums, tracks, and most merch can be purchased on the web. It’s the highest-traffic page on the site and the first stop for most users.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Migrated the page to microservices infrastructure, unlocking A/B testing, faster deployment, and dramatic performance gains
            </li>
            <li>
              Co-designed the new interface alongside product and design; prioritized improved merchandising, modernization, clarity, accessibility (I used to be a designer+dev!)
            </li>
            <li>
              Increased conversion by X%, improved accessibility by Y%, improved page speed by Z%
            </li>
            <li>
              Tackled extreme complexity: nearly 100 permutations to support artist customization, pricing, downloads, subscriber-only content, bundles, and more, all without prior automated test coverage
            </li>
            <li>
              Championed accessibility across engineering, product, and design, establishing a new org-wide baseline
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Bandcamp Daily Redesign (2019)</h4>
            <p>
              Bandcamp Daily is the editorial voice of Bandcamp. It’s a home for music discovery, curation, and longform writing, written by real humans.
            </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Led the engineering effort to redesign and rebuild Bandcamp’s editorial publication from a Wordpress-hosted blog into a fully integrated, responsive, and browsable media experience
            </li>
            <li>
              Selected and integrated a headless CMS; engineered a custom ingestion pipeline to store and normalize articles (~3,500) into Bandcamp’s infrastructure for performance and site-wide integration of editorial content
            </li>
            <li>
              Built custom frontend with a better listening + reading experience, including inline players, wishlisting and following, and deep merch integration
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborated with editorial staff to shape workflows and onboard them to new tooling
            </li>
            <li>
              Greatly improved article discovery by exposing ability to browse by franchise, author, and genre
            </li>
            <li>
              Delivered a professional, Bandcamp-branded publication experience that increased engagement and aligned with the rest of the platform
            </li>
          </ul>
